# VIRiONT Pipeline

# Quick presentation

This pipeline is designed to analyse viral data from nanopore sequencing. It was primary developed to analyse HBV data, but was extended also to HDV. However, this pipeline can be adapted for other virus aswell with custom preparations specific to the virus.

This pipeline was primary designed for studying nanopore's long read sequencing (about 3kb,according to the full HBV genome size). If you plan to use this workflow on shorter reads, be sure to chose and adapt parameters used for the filtering step (*rule trimming*).

Keep in mind that multiple infection are curently not supported. Only the consensus for the best-matching reference is generated.  
However it's possible to check the barplot summarizing blastn results to possibly detect them.

# Workflow

The pipeline take as input uncompressed fastq from demultiplexed nanopore data, usually stored like this:  
```
barcoding/barcode01/*.fastq
barcoding/barcode02/*.fastq
...
barcoding/barcode24/*.fastq
``` 
For each barcode, here is the global workflow:  
**Step1** => merging (in several fastq in the barcode rep) and trimming fastq using given parameters. 
**Step2** => removing human read from fastq files.  
**Step3** => blastn research on each reference for get the best maching reference.     
**Step4** => build consensus sequence on the best matching reference.

# Requirements & Tools

Instalation and use of the tools required for VIRiONT is fully managed by conda and snakemake.  
Environment files and software versions are available in the *env/* folder.  

# Quick using steps

Step 1 : Get and install Anaconda here if needed => https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual <=  
You may need to start new terminal for starting using conda.   
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Anaconda3-2020.07-Linux-x86_64.sh #Simply follow screen instructions for installing conda.
```
Step 2 : make sure snakemake is installed on your computer. 
```
conda -h
conda -V
``` 
Snakemake 3.9.0 version or above is required for conda interaction.  
You can quikly create a new conda environment with the latest available snakemake version by using this command(currently the 5.20.1 version):  
```
conda create -c bioconda -c conda-forge -n VIRiONT_env snakemake-minimal
```
Step 3 : download latest version of the pipeline using git command:  
```
git clone https://github.com/Stygiophobic/VIRiONT.git
```
Step 4 : launch the pipeline by executing:  
```
conda activate VIRiONT_env
cd VIRiONT
./VIRiONT.sh
```

# Pipeline ouputs

All pipeline output are stored in the choosen path (see below).For each analysis, the following output are produced:  
**00_SUPPDATA/REFSEQ** folder , containing all the splited references from the main reference fasta given in input.  
**00_SUPPDATA/BD** folder, containing the database built using blast.  
**01_MERGED** folder, containing merged fastq.  
**02_TRIMMED** folder, containing trimmed fastq by NanoFilt with the given parameters.  
**03_DEHOSTING** folder, containing dehosted (non human) bam.  
**04_BLASTN_ANALYSIS** folder, containing the blastn analysis using R, including the list of reads matching with the best reference, with barplot of reference repartition for each barcode.  
**05_BESTREF_FILTERED** folder, containing fastq with read corresponding with best reference only using seqkit.  
BAM folder, containing sorted and indexed bam from each filtered fastq, and mapped on their respecting best matching reference.  
**06_BAM** folder, containing bam aligned on the best reference.  
**07_COVERAGE** folder, containing coverage table from each bam using bedtools,and coverage plots compiled in one pdf.  
**08_VCF** foler, containing mpileup and variant calling results.  
**09_CONSENSUS** folder, containing consencus sequences generated by a custom perl script.  
**10_10_QC_ANALYSIS** folder, containing several metrics.  


# Input and configuration

Here is a view on the parameters to check before launching analysis. To change parameters, you have to open VIRiONT/VIRiONT.sh with a text editor. All parameters are located in the ###### CONFIGURATION ####### section.

**data_loc** : path where fastq data are stored. Be sure this path leads on all barcode folders you want to analyse.Currently, only fastq repositories marked as "barcode*" are interpreted as repository data. If needed, rename your rep as "barcode*".  
**result_loc** : path leading to the output folders produced by the analysis. NB: the pipeline will recursively create the path, so a previous mkdir is unnecessary.  
**ref_loc** : path to the file containing all references sequences used for the blastn analysis. We you need to create a new one, check examples in *ref/* folder.  
**ref_table** : path to the Table (currently a csv is required) containing reference list for the blastn analysis. /!\ Column must correspond to the fasta name in ref_loc for correctly computing the best reference, and each row must correspond to each fasta header in the reference fasta file. Please check analysis/table_analysis if needed for an example.  
**min_length** : minimal read size required for passing the filtering step.  
**max_length** : maximal read size required for passing the filtering step.  
**head** : nucleotid length to trimm in 5'.  
**tail** : nucleotid length to trimm in 3'.  
**Vfreq** : minor variant frequency threshold.  
**thread_number** : Define number of threads to use for the analysis.  
**mem_cost** : define the memory amount in mb to use for the analysis.
